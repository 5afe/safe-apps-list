You can explain here if there is a desired date/blocker that should be considered to add the app before or after.
This shouldn't be used as a deadline to request the app to be added, but just some feedback for time relevant events (eg. app shouldn't be public until some days later, a coordinated anouncement should be set together with the app launch, resources not ready until a specific date...)
